In my own words:

Lexical Scope:  every funciton definition starts a new lexical scope. 

while/if blocks:  blocks does not start new scope. In newer Javascript version, you can use "let" keyword to start a new block scope.

When a function is called, a new execution context is created. The execution is three steps:
  1. The declaration of new variables, arguments, functions.
  2. The execution of code.
  3. The determination of "this" variable.
